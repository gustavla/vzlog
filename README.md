vzlog
=====

Tool for logging rich content, particularly plots and images. Work just started, so nothing to see yet.

Features
--------
Will include:

* Logging rich content data, such as plots, images, etc. The log file will be a compressed binary saved with hdf5 (probably using PyTables). 
* The log file will be examined through the vzlog viewer (built with Qt), hopefully with a built-in Python shell.
* Log to different frames and replay in real-time.
